# C-Sharks UML Editor Web App

Team C-Sharks' UML Editor is an application that allows the user to add, delete, and edit UML classes all through its web GUI. Each UML class can hold different attributes and relationships between each other, all of which can be added, deleted, and/or renamed. The editor can also save and load diagrams to be worked on later.

**Prerequisites**
[Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

## Running the Application

1. In Visual Studio, navigate to File > Clone Repository and enter the link: <br> (https://github.com/mucsci-students/2022fa-420-C-Sharks)
2. After cloning the repository, open it as a project
3. Select the dropdown next to the green play/run button ("Select Startup Item") and choose _UML.sln_

**Saving / Loading Files**
To save or load a diagram, use the Save and Load icons on the toolbar to do so through the web server. Alternatively, if you'd like to save your diagram locally, use the "Export" option in the _Help_ menu, and "Import" option to load a local file.
